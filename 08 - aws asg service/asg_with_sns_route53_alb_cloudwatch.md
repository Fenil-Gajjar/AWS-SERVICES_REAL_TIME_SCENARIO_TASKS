# Real-Time Project Implementation: Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with SNS, Route 53, ALB, and CloudWatch

## Introduction
This project provides a hands-on implementation of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) integrated with various AWS services to create a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant web application. We will configure an ASG to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand, set up notifications using Amazon SNS, integrate with Route 53 for domain resolution, use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic distribution, and monitor with CloudWatch Alarms.

## Project Overview
We will deploy a simple web application that demonstrates the core functionalities of an ASG:

*   **Automatic Scaling:** Instances will scale in and out based on CPU utilization.
*   **Load Balancing:** Traffic will be distributed across instances by an ALB.
*   **Health Checks:** ASG will replace unhealthy instances.
*   **Notifications:** SNS will send alerts on scaling events.
*   **Domain Resolution:** Route 53 will point a custom domain to the ALB.

## Technologies Used

*   **AWS EC2:** Virtual servers to host the web application.
*   **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** Manages the fleet of EC2 instances.
*   **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Distributes incoming traffic.
*   **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):** For notifications on scaling events.
*   **Amazon Route 53:** Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
*   **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitoring and observability service.
*   **IAM:** Identity and Access Management for permissions.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create an IAM Role for EC2 Instances

We need an IAM role that grants EC2 instances permissions to send metrics to CloudWatch and publish messages to SNS.

1.  **Navigate to IAM:** Open the AWS Management Console and go to IAM.
2.  **Create Role:** Click on `Roles` in the left navigation pane, then `Create role`.
3.  **Select Service:** Choose `AWS service` and `EC2` as the use case. Click `Next`.
4.  **Add Permissions:** Search for and attach the following policies:
    *   `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` (or `CloudWatchFullAccess` for simplicity in a lab environment)
    *   `AmazonSNSFullAccess` (for publishing notifications)
5.  **Name and Create Role:** Give the role a descriptive name (e.g., `EC2-ASG-Role`) and click `Create role`.

### Step 2: Create a Launch Template

The Launch Template defines the configuration for instances launched by the ASG.

1.  **Navigate to EC2:** Open the AWS Management Console and go to EC2.
2.  **Create Launch Template:** In the left navigation pane, under `Instances`, click `Launch Templates`, then `Create launch template`.
3.  **Template Name:** Provide a name (e.g., `ASG-Web-Template`).
4.  **AMI:** Select an Amazon Linux 2 AMI (or Ubuntu 22.04 as used in the previous example).
5.  **Instance Type:** Choose `t2.micro`.
6.  **Key Pair:** Select an existing key pair or create a new one.
7.  **Network Settings:**
    *   **Subnets:** Do NOT select a subnet here. The ASG will choose subnets.
    *   **Security Groups:** Create a new security group or select an existing one that allows HTTP (80) and SSH (22) inbound traffic from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
8.  **Advanced Details (User Data):** Add the following script to install Apache and create a simple web page. This script will run when the instance launches.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install -y httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello from EC2 Instance $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```
    *(Note: If using Ubuntu, replace `yum` with `apt` and `httpd` with `nginx` or `apache2` as appropriate.)*

9.  **IAM Instance Profile:** Select the `EC2-ASG-Role` created in Step 1.
10. **Create Launch Template:** Click `Create launch template`.

### Step 3: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

An ALB will distribute incoming traffic across the instances managed by the ASG.

1.  **Navigate to EC2:** Go to EC2 Dashboard.
2.  **Create Load Balancer:** In the left navigation pane, under `Load Balancing`, click `Load Balancers`, then `Create Load Balancer`.
3.  **Select ALB:** Choose `Application Load Balancer` and click `Create`.
4.  **Basic Configuration:**
    *   **Load balancer name:** `ASG-ALB`
    *   **Scheme:** `Internet-facing`
    *   **VPC:** Select your default VPC or a custom VPC.
    *   **Mappings:** Select at least two public subnets across different Availability Zones.
5.  **Security Groups:** Create a new security group or select an existing one that allows HTTP (80) inbound traffic from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
6.  **Listeners and Routing:**
    *   **Listener:** `HTTP:80`
    *   **Default action:** `Forward to target groups`
    *   **Target Group:** Click `Create a target group`.
        *   **Target group name:** `ASG-TG`
        *   **Protocol:** `HTTP`
        *   **Port:** `80`
        *   **Health checks:** `HTTP` on path `/`
        *   Click `Create target group`.
7.  **Create Load Balancer:** Go back to the ALB creation page, select the newly created `ASG-TG` as the default target group, and click `Create load balancer`.

### Step 4: Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

Now, we will create the ASG that uses the Launch Template and integrates with the ALB.

1.  **Navigate to EC2:** Go to EC2 Dashboard.
2.  **Create Auto Scaling Group:** In the left navigation pane, under `Auto Scaling`, click `Auto Scaling Groups`, then `Create Auto Scaling group`.
3.  **Choose Launch Template:** Select the `ASG-Web-Template` created in Step 2. Click `Next`.
4.  **Configure ASG:**
    *   **Auto Scaling group name:** `My-ASG`
    *   **VPC:** Select the same VPC as your ALB.
    *   **Subnets:** Select the private subnets where your instances should be launched (ensure they are in the same AZs as your ALB subnets).
5.  **Load Balancing:**
    *   **Attach to an existing load balancer:** Choose `Application Load Balancer`.
    *   **Choose from your load balancers:** Select `ASG-ALB`.
    *   **Target groups:** Select `ASG-TG`.
6.  **Health Checks:**
    *   **Health check type:** `ELB` (This ensures ASG uses ALB health checks).
    *   **Health check grace period:** `300` seconds (time for instance to boot up).
7.  **Instance Refresh (Optional):** Leave default for now.
8.  **Group Size:**
    *   **Desired capacity:** `2`
    *   **Minimum capacity:** `1`
    *   **Maximum capacity:** `4`
9.  **Scaling Policies:**
    *   **Target tracking scaling policy:**
        *   **Metric type:** `Average CPU utilization`
        *   **Target value:** `50` (e.g., maintain 50% CPU utilization)
    *   *(Optional: Add simple scaling policies or scheduled scaling if needed for specific scenarios.)*
10. **Notifications (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Click `Add notification`.
    *   **Create new topic:** `ASG-Notifications`
    *   **With email endpoint:** Enter your email address.
    *   **Notification Type:** Select `Launch`, `Terminate`, `Fail to Launch`, `Fail to Terminate`.
    *   Click `Create`.
11. **Tags (Optional):** Add tags (e.g., `Name: My-ASG-Instance`).
12. **Create Auto Scaling Group:** Click `Create Auto Scaling group`.

### Step 5: Configure CloudWatch Alarms (for Scaling Policies)

While target tracking policies automatically create CloudWatch alarms, you can also create custom alarms to trigger scaling actions or notifications.

1.  **Navigate to CloudWatch:** Open the AWS Management Console and go to CloudWatch.
2.  **Create Alarm:** In the left navigation pane, click `Alarms`, then `Create alarm`.
3.  **Select Metric:** Click `Select metric`.
    *   Search for `EC2` metrics, then `Per-Instance Metrics`.
    *   Select `CPUUtilization` for instances in your ASG (filtered by `AutoScalingGroupName`).
4.  **Specify Metric and Conditions:**
    *   **Statistic:** `Average`
    *   **Period:** `5 minutes`
    *   **Threshold type:** `Static`
    *   **Whenever CPUUtilization is:** `Greater/Equal`
    *   **than:** `70` (e.g., scale out if CPU > 70%)
5.  **Configure Actions:**
    *   **Notification:** Select the SNS topic created in Step 4 (`ASG-Notifications`).
    *   **Auto Scaling action:** Select your ASG (`My-ASG`).
        *   **Add:** `1` instance
        *   **Remove:** `1` instance
6.  **Name and Create Alarm:** Give the alarm a name (e.g., `High-CPU-Alarm`) and click `Create alarm`.

### Step 6: Configure Route 53 (Optional)

To access your application using a custom domain name, you can integrate Route 53 with your ALB.

1.  **Navigate to Route 53:** Open the AWS Management Console and go to Route 53.
2.  **Hosted Zones:** Select your hosted zone (or create a new public hosted zone for your domain).
3.  **Create Record:** Click `Create record`.
    *   **Record name:** `www` (or your desired subdomain)
    *   **Record type:** `A`
    *   **Alias:** Enable `Alias`.
    *   **Route traffic to:** Choose `Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer`.
    *   **Region:** Select the region where your ALB is deployed.
    *   **Choose Load Balancer:** Select your `ASG-ALB`.
4.  **Create Records:** Click `Create records`.

### Step 7: Test the Auto Scaling Group

1.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the DNS name of your ALB (found in the EC2 Load Balancers section) or your custom domain if configured with Route 53.
    You should see the 


message "Hello from EC2 Instance [instance-id]". Refresh a few times to see if it changes (if you have multiple instances).

2.  **Simulate Load:** To test scaling out, you can use a tool like `stress` or `ApacheBench` from another EC2 instance or your local machine to generate CPU load on your instances. For example, if you SSH into one of your instances:

    ```bash
    sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
    sudo yum install stress -y
    stress --cpu 8 --timeout 300s # This will put 8 CPU cores under stress for 5 minutes
    ```

    Monitor your ASG in the AWS console. You should see new instances launching as CPU utilization increases.

3.  **Observe Scaling In:** Once the load is removed, the CPU utilization will drop. After a few minutes (based on your CloudWatch alarm and ASG cooldown period), the ASG should start terminating instances until it reaches the desired capacity.

4.  **Check SNS Notifications:** Verify that you received email notifications for instance launches and terminations.

## Summary of What We Accomplished
