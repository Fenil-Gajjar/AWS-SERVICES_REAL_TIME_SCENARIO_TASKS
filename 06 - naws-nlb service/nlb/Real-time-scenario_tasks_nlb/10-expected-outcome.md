# 🎯 Expected Outcome After Implementing AWS NLB Setup
Once the AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) setup is completed successfully, users should observe the following expected outcomes:

✅ 1. SSL/TLS Certificate Issued and Validated in ACM
- In AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), the status of the certificate should change to "Issued" after DNS validation via Route 53.
- You should see the certificate listed under "Issued Certificates" when you navigate to ACM in the AWS Console.

✅ 2. AWS VPC & EC2 Instances Deployed Successfully
- A VPC (nlb-vpc) is created in the us-east-1 region with three private and three public subnets.
- Three EC2 instances (Private-1A, Private-1B, Private-1C) are running in the private subnets.
- You can check the status in AWS EC2 → Instances (all should be in the "Running" state).

✅ 3. Nginx Installed and Serving Custom Pages on EC2 Instances
When you log in to any private instance (Private-1A, Private-1B, or Private-1C) and run:
`curl http://localhost`
You should see a response with the instance hostname and a region-specific identifier:
`US-EAST-1A-SERVERS`

✅ 4. Target Group & Network Load Balancer (NLB) Setup
- The target group (nlb-tg) should show all three EC2 instances as "Healthy" in AWS EC2 → Target Groups → Targets Tab.
- The Network Load Balancer (nlb-lb) should be active and successfully routing traffic.
- In AWS EC2 → Load Balancers, the status of the NLB should be "Active".

✅ 5. Domain Name Resolution via Route 53
- The Route 53 DNS record (www.your_domain_name.com) should be properly mapped to the NLB.
You can verify DNS resolution using the following command:
`nslookup www.your_domain_name.com`
- The response should return the NLB’s public IP.

✅ 6. Accessing the Load Balancer in a Browser
When you open a browser and navigate to:
`https://www.your_domain_name.com`

- The page should load securely (🔒 HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificate).

You should see responses from different EC2 instances like:
`US-EAST-1A-SERVERS`
`US-EAST-1B-SERVERS`
`US-EAST-1C-SERVERS`
- Refreshing the page multiple times should distribute traffic across the three EC2 instances (demonstrating load balancing).

✅ 7. Automated Traffic Distribution Validation
Running the traffic validation script:
```bash
while true
do
curl -sL https://www.your_domain_name.com | grep -i 'US-EAST'
sleep 10
done
```
The output should display responses from different EC2 instances in a round-robin fashion, proving that NLB is balancing the load correctly:
`US-EAST-1A-SERVERS`
`US-EAST-1C-SERVERS`
`US-EAST-1B-SERVERS`
`US-EAST-1A-SERVERS`

🎯 Final Confirmation - AWS Console Checks
- ACM Certificate → Status: ✅ Issued
- EC2 Instances → Status: ✅ Running (3 private instances)
- Target Group (nlb-tg) → Status: ✅ Healthy (All instances are marked "Healthy")
- Load Balancer (nlb-lb) → Status: ✅ Active
- Route 53 Record (www.your_domain_name.com) → Status: ✅ Resolving to NLB
- Browser & Curl Requests → ✅ Load Balancing Verified

🚀 Conclusion: Fully Functional NLB Setup!
After implementing this setup, you now have a fully functional Network Load Balancer (NLB) with:

✅ SSL/TLS encryption via ACM
✅ Traffic load balancing across private EC2 instances
✅ Route 53 DNS resolution with a custom domain
✅ High availability using multi-AZ deployment
✅ Efficiently distributed network traffic

Your AWS NLB setup is successfully completed! 🎉 🚀
