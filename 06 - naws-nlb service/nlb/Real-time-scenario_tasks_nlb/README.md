# NLB Implementation Project Overview

This section provides a step-by-step guide to implementing an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) from scratch. It covers the configuration of EC2 instances, VPC, Route 53, SSL/TLS, and AWS Certificate Manager to ensure a clear understanding of how NLB efficiently distributes traffic while maintaining high availability, low latency, and fault tolerance.

## What You Will Learn in This Project?

- âœ… Setting up a custom VPC with subnets and security groups.
- âœ… Deploying EC2 instances as backend servers.
- âœ… Configuring an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) to distribute traffic.
- âœ… Integrating Route 53 for domain-based load balancing.
- âœ… Securing connections using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and SSL/TLS.
- âœ… Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance with health checks and multi-AZ deployment.

This project is designed to mirror real-world AWS implementations, ensuring that you gain practical experience with AWS services. By the end, you will have a fully functional scalable and secure load balancing solution using NLB.
