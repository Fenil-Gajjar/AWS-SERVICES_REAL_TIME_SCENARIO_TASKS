2.  Paste the following sample code (update the connection string with your actual RDS endpoint, admin username, and Master Password):

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Replace with your actual password and RDS endpoint
engine = create_engine("mysql+pymysql://admin:YourMasterPassword@<RDS_ENDPOINT>:3306/main-db")

# Establish a connection
connection = engine.connect()

# Example query: Create two sample tables and insert data (adjust as needed)
create_tables_query = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table1 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table2 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    description VARCHAR(255)
);
INSERT INTO table1 (name) VALUES (\'Alice\'), (\'Bob\');
INSERT INTO table2 (description) VALUES (\'Description for table2 row1\'), (\'Description for table2 row2\');
"""
connection.execute(create_tables_query)

# Retrieve data from one table
result = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM table1;")
rows = result.fetchall()

# Close the connection
connection.close()

# Print the fetched data
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

3.  Save the file and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter if using nano).

##### 9.2 Run the Python Script

1.  Execute the script using: `python3 sample.py`
2.  Verify that the output displays the rows fetched from `table1`.

## Final Verification and Summary

### What We Have Achieved:

*   **RDS MySQL Database:**
    *   Created a DB subnet group (`subnet-db`) with 3 public subnets (across 3 AZs).
    *   Launched a Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance (`main-db`) using the Production template with specific configuration (`db.t3.medium`, 20 GB `gp2` storage, public access enabled, and Enhanced Monitoring enabled).
*   **EC2 Instances:**
    *   Launched a Windows (`workbench`) instance (`t2.medium`) to serve as a client for MySQL Workbench.
    *   Launched an Ubuntu instance (`t2.micro`) for Python-based database access.
*   **MySQL Workbench Configuration on Windows:**
    *   Connected to the RDS MySQL instance using the provided endpoint, admin username, and Master Password.
    *   Created tables and inserted sample data, then retrieved and verified the data.
*   **Python Database Access on Ubuntu:**
    *   Installed Python 3, pip, and necessary libraries (`pymysql` and `sqlalchemy`).
    *   Created and ran a Python script to connect to the RDS MySQL instance, execute SQL queries (table creation and data retrieval), and print the retrieved data.

### How to Verify:

*   **MySQL Workbench (Windows):**
    *   Open MySQL Workbench and connect to the `mainDB` connection.
    *   Check the Schemas panel for the created tables and run `SELECT` queries to see the inserted data.
*   **Python Script (Ubuntu):**
    *   Run `python3 sample.py` and confirm that the console output shows the expected data from the database.

## Explanation of the Task: Deploying & Connecting to an AWS RDS MySQL Database

This task sets up an AWS RDS MySQL database, connects to it using MySQL Workbench from a Windows Workbench instance, and retrieves data programmatically from an Ubuntu instance using Python. Below is a breakdown of what exactly this task does and why each step is necessary.

### 1. Setting Up an RDS MySQL Database

#### What are we doing?

We create an Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) MySQL database with a highly available setup using Multi-AZ deployment and a custom DB subnet group for networking.

#### Why are we doing it?

*   RDS provides a managed database service, reducing operational overhead.
*   Multi-AZ ensures high availability by maintaining a standby replica.
*   DB subnet groups control where the RDS instance is launched within our AWS VPC.

#### Steps Involved:

1.  Create a DB subnet group (Subnet groups define in which subnets the RDS instance can launch).
2.  Launch an RDS MySQL instance using this subnet group.
3.  Enable necessary configurations (such as multi-AZ, security groups, and public access).
4.  Obtain the RDS endpoint for connecting to the database.

### 2. Launching Two EC2 Instances

We create two instances for interacting with the database:

1.  **Workbench Instance (Windows Server 2019)**
    *   Used for graphical database access using MySQL Workbench.
    *   We disable security features to allow easy software installation.
    *   We install Google Chrome, Visual C++ Redistributable, and MySQL Workbench.
2.  **Ubuntu Instance**
    *   Used for programmatically connecting to the RDS database using Python.
    *   We install Python, pymysql, and SQLAlchemy to run scripts that fetch data.

#### Why are we doing this?

*   The Workbench instance allows manual database management via MySQL Workbench.
*   The Ubuntu instance helps automate database interactions using Python scripts.

### 3. Connecting to the RDS MySQL Database from Workbench

#### What are we doing?

After setting up the Workbench instance, we:

1.  Connect to the RDS MySQL database using MySQL Workbench.
2.  Create tables and insert sample data using SQL queries.
3.  Retrieve data manually to verify the database is working.

#### Why are we doing it?

*   Workbench is a GUI-based tool for managing MySQL databases.
*   This step ensures the database is working correctly before using it programmatically.

### 4. Connecting to RDS MySQL from Ubuntu via Python

#### What are we doing?

We:

1.  Install Python and required libraries (pymysql, sqlalchemy).
2.  Write a Python script to:
    *   Establish a connection with the MySQL RDS database.
    *   Retrieve and print data from tables created in Workbench.
    *   Close the connection after execution.

#### Why are we doing it?

*   This step simulates real-world application behavior where backend services interact with a database.
*   Validates programmatic access to the RDS database.

### Summary: What Does This Task Achieve?

*   Creates an AWS RDS MySQL database with a Multi-AZ setup.
*   Launches two EC2 instances (Windows for GUI access, Ubuntu for automation).
*   Connects to MySQL Workbench on Windows to manually manage the database.
*   Programmatically connects to RDS MySQL from Ubuntu using Python scripts.

This setup simulates a real-world cloud-based database environment where different applications and users access the same database for data management and retrieval.
